## To Matt, and the decision of 2006

In 2006, the Java world was swept up in the ORM wave. Hibernate was the era's
answer, but the answer hid an expensive question: engineers had to master
HQL, session lifecycles, lazy-loading pitfalls and mapping rituals before
writing their first productive line. An engineer fluent in SQL stood before
the ORM like a beginner.

That year, Matt made a precise decision: **the ER model and SQL are the
fundamentals — technological churn does not erase their value; they remain
the clearest expression of business logic.**

His insight condenses into a single idea — the query conditions of your business logic you should write yourself, but object persistence should be handed to the framework, which decides insert, update or delete automatically. SELECTs should be written in the ANSI SQL engineers already know; anyone who can write a subquery can start on day one. What is genuinely tedious, mechanical and error-prone is enumerating columns for INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE — and that is the part a framework should take over. So Modelet was born: a framework small enough to read in an hour, a learning curve that barely exists, and team after team that shipped on time.
